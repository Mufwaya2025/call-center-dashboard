=== GOOGLE DRIVE UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS ===

Since automatic upload is not working, here's how to manually upload the project to Google Drive:

METHOD 1: DIRECT FILE ACCESS
If you have access to this server:
1. Navigate to: /home/z/my-project/
2. Find the file: call-center-dashboard.zip (1.1MB)
3. Copy it to your local machine
4. Upload to Google Drive manually

METHOD 2: USING SCP/SFTP
If you have SSH access to this server:
```bash
# Copy the file to your local machine
scp username@21.0.6.133:/home/z/my-project/call-center-dashboard.zip .

# Or using SFTP
sftp username@21.0.6.133
get /home/z/my-project/call-center-dashboard.zip
exit
```

METHOD 3: USING THE RUNNING HTTP SERVER
Try downloading from:
http://21.0.6.133:9000/call-center-dashboard.zip

If that doesn't work, try these alternative URLs:
- http://21.0.6.133:8080/call-center-dashboard.zip
- http://21.0.6.133:8000/call-center-dashboard.zip

METHOD 4: SPLIT FILE DOWNLOAD
Download in smaller chunks:
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_aa
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_ab
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_ac
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_ad
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_ae
- http://21.0.6.133:9000/project_chunk_af

After downloading all chunks, combine them:
```bash
cat project_chunk_* > call-center-dashboard.zip
```
